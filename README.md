KinectDrummer
=============

Virtual drumming application with Kinect for Windows 1.  Uses C# and XAML...for now.

At the moment this is a tutorial based on Kinect for Windows SDK Programming Guide [eBook].

I have written the code as I work through the book, so most of it is different, but some parts
are quite similar.  I have copied and pasted none of the code from the book.
